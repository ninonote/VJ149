To set up a Unity 5 Material, follow the steps:

- Create a new Material
- Select "Standard-Specular Setup" Shader
- Rendering Mode: Opaque
- In the Albedo spot, attach texture called "BuildingPack1Diffuse.jpg" from the Modern Building Pack 1\Textures\Legacy folder
- Albedo color modifier: pure white
- In the specular slot, add "BuildingPack1Specular_Standard.psd" from the Building Pack 1\Textures\Standard folder
- In the normal map slot, add "BuildingPack1Bump_Legacy.psd" from the Building Pack 1\Textures\Legacy folder with modifier 0.02

Also, don't forget the add a skybox in the Lighting tab so the buildings have something to reflect

That is all, enjoy and thank you for purchasing :D
